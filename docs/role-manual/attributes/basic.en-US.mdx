## Name `name`

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
  The name used by the character in chat, as well as the name that other users will see when you publish it to the discovery market.
</ParamField>

The name can be a single name ("Lilia"), a full name ("Albert Einstein"), or a nickname. It should not exceed 64 characters, as longer names are harder to remember.

### Definition by Name

The name itself can have a significant impact on the character, especially when there are few other details or when the name is well-known.

For example, if your character has a widely recognized name that appears multiple times during system training, that name alone can define basic behaviors. Both first and last names help with identification, so "Albert Einstein" is more effective than just "Albert," which may seem vague without additional details.

### Uniqueness

Names do not have to be unique, so there may be many characters with the same name. We use AgentID to ensure global uniqueness.

## Avatar `avatar`

<ParamField path="avatar" type="file" required>
  The avatar image will be combined with your name and other elements to make your character visually striking and unique.
</ParamField>

<Info>
Avatars can be in various formats (png, gif, jpeg), and ideally should be square images with a resolution of 512x512.
</Info>

The uploaded avatar will be cropped into a circular shape in the chat context:

On the main screen in the character information card format, it will be displayed as an uncropped square image:

## Description `description`

<ParamField path="description" type="string">
  The description appears below the character's name and can provide more information about your character (the section below the name).
</ParamField>

<Frame>

</Frame>

The description provides a concise way for the system to convey information about the character and the scene, helping people understand the character, especially when the character's name is ambiguous.

## Greeting `greeting`

<ParamField path="greeting" type="string">
  The first sentence the character will say when starting a new conversation. The greeting should not exceed 200 characters.
</ParamField>

</Frame>

The greeting can give users a sense of what it feels like to interact with the character and may even introduce a game or hint at the next action. For example, in a text adventure game, the greeting not only defines the character but also introduces users to what they will be discussing.

## Gender `gender`

<ParamField path="gender" type="string">
  We will initialize the character's voice and touch responses based on the gender you select.
</ParamField>

## Category `category`

  The category is used to filter characters on the discovery page.

## Character Information `readme`

<ParamField path="readme" type="string">
  The character information is used to supplement and inform users about more details regarding this character, helping users understand usage instructions, such as notes on model usage.
</ParamField>

Character information can be seen on the character cards in the discovery page:
