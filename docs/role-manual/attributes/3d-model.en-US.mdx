LobeVidol uses humanoid Humandroids in the `VRM` format as the 3D models for its characters. Models in the VRM format typically lean towards a more anime-style aesthetic:

## Uploading 3D Models

You can upload VRM files by clicking on the upload area located on the right side of the character settings page:

If there are already uploaded model files in that area, you can drag a new model file over the existing model to replace it:
