## Features of .vrma Files

1. **Animation Description**:
   - .vrma files use the glTF animation format, capable of describing animation information associated with VRM models, including skeletal animations, facial expressions, and gaze control.

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - This format is designed to be used across multiple applications and platforms, ensuring that users can share and apply the same animation data in different environments.

3. **Standardized Implementation**:
   - The UniVRM plugin provides a standard solution for importing and exporting .vrma files in Unity, allowing developers to easily integrate these animations into their projects.

4. **Support for Custom Expressions**:
   - In addition to preset expressions, .vrma files also support custom expressions, as long as the target VRM model has the corresponding expressive capabilities.

By using .vrma files, users can conveniently implement complex character animations in various VR applications and games, enhancing the virtual reality experience.
