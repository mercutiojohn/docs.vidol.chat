The steps to convert FBX files to VRM files can be achieved through several methods, primarily using Blender or Unity.

## Method 1: Using Blender

1. **Install Blender**
   Download and install Blender (available for Windows, macOS, and Linux).

2. **Install the VRM Plugin**
   - Download the VRM plugin (such as the VRM Addon for Blender).
   - In Blender, open the "Edit" menu, select "Preferences," then click "Install" in the "Add-ons" tab and choose the downloaded plugin file.

3. **Import the FBX File**
   - In Blender, use the "File" menu to select "Import," then choose the FBX format, locate, and import your FBX model.

4. **Set Up Bones and Shapes**
   - Add necessary skeletons and shape keyframes (Blendshapes) as needed.

5. **Export as VRM**
   - Select "Export" from the "File" menu, then choose the VRM format, set the export options, and save the file\[1]\[2].

## Method 2: Using Unity

1. **Install Unity**
   Download and install Unity (recommended version is 2019.4.x).

2. **Import UniVRM**
   - Download the latest version of UniVRM (.unitypackage file) and create a new Unity project.
   - Drag the downloaded UniVRM package into Unity to import it.

3. **Import the FBX Model**
   - Drag the FBX model into the Assets folder in Unity.

4. **Set Animation Type**
   - Select the imported model, and in the Inspector window, set the "Animation Type" to "Humanoid," then click "Apply."

5. **Check Bone Configuration**
   - Click the "Configureâ€¦" button to check if the bones are correctly configured. Ensure there are no red-marked bones; if there are, corrections need to be made.

6. **Export as VRM**
   - In the Hierarchy window, select the model, then from the menu select `VRM > UniVRM > Export humanoid`.
   - Fill in the author information, click "Export," choose the save location, and complete the export\[5].

Both methods effectively convert FBX files to VRM format. Depending on personal preference and tool availability, you can choose the method that suits you best for conversion.
