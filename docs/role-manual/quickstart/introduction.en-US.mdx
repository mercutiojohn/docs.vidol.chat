## What is LobeVidol

LobeVidol is an open-source virtual companion dialogue tool based on LLM (Large Language Model) and 3D rendering technology. This guide aims to help you create your own virtual characters and bring them into the real world.

<Info>
  LobeVidol comes with a default assistant named "Lilya." You can chat with her in the chat window to experience the dialogue effects of the final character.

On the discovery page, you can browse all the characters created using our platform. Through this manual, you will learn how to become a creator of these characters.

## Elements of Character Definition

Currently, there are two main factors that influence character responses on the platform:

1. **Character Attribute Definition**: This includes system settings, voice, 3D models, LLM parameters, etc.
2. **Dialogue Context**: This refers to the context of the current conversation.

<Note>
  This guide will focus on how to define character attributes and how to upload characters to the market.
