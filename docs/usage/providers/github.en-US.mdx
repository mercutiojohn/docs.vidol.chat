## Overview

[GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) is a new feature recently launched by GitHub, designed to provide developers with a free platform to access and experiment with various AI models. GitHub Models offers an interactive sandbox environment where users can test different model parameters and prompts, observing the model's responses. The platform supports a range of advanced language models, including OpenAI's GPT-4o, Meta's Llama 3.1, and Mistral's Large 2, covering a wide array of applications from large-scale language models to task-specific models.

## GitHub Models Rate Limits

Currently, the usage of the Playground and free API is subject to limits on the number of requests per minute, daily requests, tokens per request, and concurrent requests. If the rate limit is reached, you will need to wait for the limit to reset before continuing to make requests. Different models (low, high, and embedding models) have different rate limits. For information on model types, please refer to the GitHub Marketplace.

<Warning>
  - During the testing period of GitHub Models, users need to apply to join the [waitlist](https://github.com/marketplace/models/waitlist/join) to gain access.

- Please store the access token securely, as it will only appear once. If you accidentally lose it, you will need to create a new token.
</Warning>

### 2. Configure GitHub Models in LobeVidol

1. Go to the `Settings` interface in LobeVidol.
2. Under `Language Models`, find the settings for `GitHub`.
