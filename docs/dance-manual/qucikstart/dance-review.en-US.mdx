# Document Review and Merging Process

This article will introduce the review and merging process for dance files after they are uploaded, including the creation of GitHub Issues, automatic checks, PR generation, and the final update of the dance market list.

## GitHub Issue Creation and Review

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automatic Issue Creation">
    After the dance file upload is complete, the system will automatically create a new Issue in the [lobe-vidol-market](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-vidol-market) repository, containing information about the current dance file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Labels">
    The newly created Issue will automatically be tagged with `ðŸ’ƒ Dance PR`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Check">
    The system will automatically check whether the Issue content meets the parameter specifications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Results">
    - If the check passes, the Issue will be tagged with `âœ… Auto Check Pass`.
    - If the check fails, the `ðŸ’ƒ Dance PR` tag will be removed. You will need to modify the Issue content according to the error message, and then manually re-add the `ðŸ’ƒ Dance PR` tag to trigger a re-check.
  </Step>

## GitHub PR Generation and Merging

<Steps>
  <Step title="PR Generation">
    After the Issue check passes, the system will automatically generate a Pull Request (PR) based on the Issue content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Awaiting Review">
    After the PR is generated, please patiently wait for the administrator to review and merge it.
  </Step>

## Dance Market List Update

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automatic Build">
    After the PR is merged, the system will automatically run build commands to generate the updated [dance list](https://vidol-market.lobehub.com/dances/index.json) static data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Market Update">
    LobeVidol will read the latest dance list data and display the updated content in the dance market.
