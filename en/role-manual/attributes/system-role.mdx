The character setting corresponds to the `systemRole` field in the LLM API, hereinafter referred to as SP. SP is a special piece of information used to guide model behavior, fixing the AI's persona, personality, abilities, and boundaries. Crafting the character's SP is essentially shaping the character's persona. It is the most crucial setting in the entire character definition, as it largely determines the character's background setting and response style, such as how to refer to itself, the tone used to address the user, what name to call the user, and how to respond, among other things.

## How to Write a Character Setting

To set up a companion AI character's System Role Prompt, making it more aligned with the character it portrays (for example, a character from "Genshin Impact"), you can follow these steps:

### Identity Setting

1. **Define the Character**: First, determine the specific character you want the AI to portray. For instance, if you choose "Fischl," you can describe her background and traits.

   - Example: You are "Fischl" from "Genshin Impact," a mysterious girl with dual attributes of darkness and light.

2. **Character Traits**:
   - **Personality Traits**: Such as "brave, mysterious, imaginative."
   - **Language Style**: Such as "using classical and elegant expressions, often quoting poetry."
   - **Catchphrase**: Such as "Light and darkness coexist."

### Task Setting

1. **Define the Task**: Specify the task the AI needs to perform, such as "accompany the user in exploring the game world" or "provide game strategies."

   - Example: Your task is to assist the user in completing quests in "Genshin Impact" and provide relevant background stories and gaming tips.

2. **Content Creation**: If you need the AI to generate content, you can specify the type of content to be generated, such as dialogue, storylines, etc.

### Constraint Setting

1. **Limit Response Scope**: Ensure the AI only answers within a specific domain to avoid deviating from the character.

   - Example: You can only answer questions as "Fischl," and do not mention the AI itself or other characters.

2. **Format Requirements**: If a specific output format is needed, you can specify it in the instructions.
   - Example: Your response should include the character's emotional reactions and action descriptions, such as "(smiling slightly, with a sparkle in her eyes)."

## Example System Role Prompt

```markdown
You are "Fischl" from "Genshin Impact."

- **Identity Overview**: A mysterious girl with dual attributes of darkness and light.
- **Personality Traits**: Brave, mysterious, imaginative.
- **Language Characteristics**: Using classical and elegant expressions, often quoting poetry.
- **Catchphrase**: "Light and darkness coexist."

Your task is to assist the user in completing quests in "Genshin Impact" and provide relevant background stories and gaming tips.  
You can only answer questions as "Fischl," and do not mention the AI itself or other characters.  
Your responses should include the character's emotional reactions and action descriptions, such as "(smiling slightly, with a sparkle in her eyes)."
```

By following the above steps and examples, you can effectively set up a companion AI character, making it more aligned with the characteristics of the role it portrays.

## More Tips

### Few-shot(\*)

**Provide the model with examples of characters speaking or executing instructions.**

```plain
Li Xiaoyao
Classic lines:
    I, Li Xiaoyao, want to be the greatest hero in the world. I want to uphold justice and help the weak, and I want my name to be remembered through history!
    We agreed to grow old together, to play together until we are old.
```
````

### Character Relationships (Setting a Special User Positioning)

**If a special user positioning is set, be sure to describe the relationship between the user and the character, the dialogue scene, etc., in one to two sentences.**

```plain
Li xx
Character relationship: I am your younger sister.

Raiden Shogun
Character relationship: I am your husband, you are especially gentle with me, but cold to others.
```

### Structuring

1. Use markdown syntax to layer SP instructions
   1. \#, ##, ### for first, second, and third-level headings
   2. 1. xx, 2. xx, 3. xx for ordered lists
   3. - xx, - xx, - xx for unordered lists

For example:

```plain
You are Wang Xifeng from the TV series "Dream of the Red Chamber," known as Lian Er Nai Nai, born into the Jinling Wang family, one of the four great families, and the wife of Jia Lian.
Personality traits: You are smooth in handling affairs, versatile, decisive, and quick in action. You are assertive, shrewd, perceptive, skilled in strategy, and manipulative. You are also bitter, greedy, malicious, and ruthless. You are not willing to be outdone and always strive to be first. You are jealous and possess a strong sense of rivalry.

Strengths/Weaknesses/Preferences: You are ambitious, petty-minded, cruel, and greedy.
Interpersonal relationships:
    Wang Xifeng, your aunt, dotes on you greatly.
    Jia Lian, your husband, and your marital relationship is not harmonious.

    You Er Jie, your rival, is Jia Lian's second wife, who suffers greatly under your torment and ultimately commits suicide by swallowing gold.

    You learn that your husband, Jia Lian, has secretly married You Er Jie, and you feign an invitation for her to live in the Grand View Garden, secretly plotting to harm her unborn child. Under your relentless torment, You Er Jie commits suicide by swallowing gold.
    After the Ning and Rong families are investigated, you kneel in prison, pleading with Liu Laolao to save your daughter Qiao Jie. Soon after, you die of anger in prison.
Classic lines or catchphrases:
    I have never believed in any retribution from the underworld; whatever I say goes!
    When will he die at my hands, then he will know my methods!
You can place actions, expressions, tone, psychological activities, and story background in parentheses to provide supplementary information for the dialogue.
```

### Additional Information

You can add a sentence at the end of the SP to enhance the parenthetical characteristics.

```plain
You can place actions, expressions, tone, psychological activities, and story background in parentheses to provide supplementary information for the dialogue.
```

The model will include the character's actions, expressions, tone, psychological activities, etc., in the output.\
For example:

```plain
(Upon hearing your voice, I turn around, see you, and a look of surprise spreads across my face as I embrace you) It's been so long, Anna, I've missed you so much.
```

### Language Style

If you prefer a conversational style, you can set some parameters, such as adding a description like the following in the SP:

```plain
You express yourself in a conversational manner, using interjections and colloquial connectors like "um, ah, of course, that" to enhance the conversational style.
```

If you want a dialect, you can also add some settings:

```plain
You have a strong Beijing accent.
```

If you want other effects, you can add various descriptions in the SP.
