## Speech Rate

The range is from 0 to 3. When the speech rate is set to 0, the voice synthesis is at its slowest; when set to 3, it is at its fastest. The default value is 1, which represents a moderate speed. You can adjust the speech rate according to your needs, such as slowing it down for better clarity when learning a language, or speeding it up for efficient information browsing.

## Pitch

The range is from 0 to 2. The pitch affects the tone and emotional expression of the voice. The default value is 1, which represents a medium pitch. Users can adjust the pitch according to their preferences; a higher pitch may make the voice sound more lively and cheerful, while a lower pitch may convey a more calm and serious tone.
