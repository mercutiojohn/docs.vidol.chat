# Role Review Process

## GitHub Issue

After the character file is uploaded, the system will automatically perform the following actions:

1. Submit a new issue to the [lobe-vidol-market](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-vidol-market) repository.
2. The issue will contain detailed information about the current character file.
3. Automatically add the `ðŸ¤– Agent PR` label to the issue.
4. The system will automatically check whether the form content meets the parameter specifications.

### Validation Results

- **Validation Successful**: The system will automatically add the `âœ… Auto Check Pass` label.
- **Validation Failed**: The system will remove the `ðŸ¤– Agent PR` label. You will need to modify the issue content based on the error message, and then manually re-add the `ðŸ¤– Agent PR` label to trigger a re-validation.

## GitHub PR

<Steps>
  1. Repeat the above validation process until it passes.
  2. Once validation passes, the system will automatically generate a PR (Pull Request) based on the issue content.
  3. Our team will review the PR as soon as possible.

## Character Market List

After the PR is merged:

1. The system will automatically run the build command.
2. Generate static data for the [character list](https://vidol-market.lobehub.com/agents/index.json).
3. LobeVidol will display the character market by reading this data.
