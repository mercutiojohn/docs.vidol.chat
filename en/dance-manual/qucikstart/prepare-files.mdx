## Introduction

<Note>
The [MMD](/dance-manual/introduction) software was born on February 24, 2008, and has gradually sparked a wave of enthusiasm online since its inception. People were amazed to discover that they could create works so easily, and countless MMD animations have been submitted both domestically and internationally. The simplest way to play an MMD animation is to choose shared resources online and combine them into your favorite dance form.

## Finding Resources

After years of development, the MMD community has a rich and comprehensive collection of dance file resources. You can find relevant resources in the following places:

- Bilibili
- Professional model websites

</Steps>

### Dance Cover

This is the cover image displayed for the dance file in the marketplace.

<Info>
The current cover image will be compressed to a size of `512*512` upon upload, and a `256*256` preview image will also be generated. Please keep this in mind when uploading.
</Info>

Regarding how to select a dance cover:

- Typically, music files will include album covers. For example, local music files downloaded from NetEase Cloud Music will contain music, and the dance cover can use the preview image of the music file.
- Of course, you can also choose an image you like to upload or generate copyright-free images through AI.

<Warning>
Please be careful not to upload images containing sensitive information.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

Once you have prepared the necessary files, the next step is to upload the relevant files to the system backend using the website's upload feature.
