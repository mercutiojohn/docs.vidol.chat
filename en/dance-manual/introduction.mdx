# Introduction to MikuMikuDance (MMD)

MikuMikuDance (abbreviated as MMD) is a free 3D animation software developed by Yu Higuchi. It allows users to import models created with other 3D modeling software, such as the VOCALOID virtual singer Hatsune Miku, to create animations. "MMD" is also commonly used to refer to the animated works produced using this software.
