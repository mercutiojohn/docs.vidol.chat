Groq's [LPU inference engine](https://wow.groq.com/news_press/groq-lpu-inference-engine-leads-in-first-independent-llm-benchmark/) has excelled in the latest independent large language model (LLM) benchmark tests, redefining the standards for AI solutions with its astonishing speed and efficiency. With the integration of LobeVidol and Groq Cloud, you can now easily leverage Groq's technology to accelerate the performance of large language models in LobeVidol.

<Info>
  The Groq LPU inference engine has consistently achieved a speed of 300 tokens per second in internal benchmark tests, confirmed by benchmarks from ArtificialAnalysis.ai, showing that Groq outperforms other providers in throughput (241 tokens per second) and total time to receive 100 output tokens (0.8 seconds).
